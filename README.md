# BusinessDayUtility

BusinessDayUtility is a class library that contains BusinessDayCounter. BusinessDayCounter can count the weekdays between two dates or business days between dates if provided  with a list of public holidays. Public holidays can be single dates or follow a rules-based recurring logic for each year.

There is test coverage of both the day counter and logic behind rules-based holidays in the seperate tests project.
